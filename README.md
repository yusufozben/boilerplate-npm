# Notes  

The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes.  
The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.  
The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.  
  
To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, you can prefix the dependency’s version with the tilde (~) character.
